# Blockchain CrowdFund Campaign App

#### Project In Development

Demo application using the Ethereum Blockchain to create a crowdfunding application

## Project Overview

This example project allows you to create a crowdfunded request using the Ethererum blockchain. It allows you to contribute to a particular campaign by sending ethereum to the campaign. Once you contrinute to the campaign you become an approver and allows you to vote on the funding request. In order for the campaign funds (ethereum) to be released more than 50% of the contributors must approve of the funding request before it can be finalized. Once the campaign funding request is approved by enough parties on the Ethereum blockchain the funds (ethereum) is sent to proper receipt ethereum address.

All request, approvals and payment finalization is managed and tracked completely on the Ethereum blockchain via a Ethereum Solidity Smart Contract.
